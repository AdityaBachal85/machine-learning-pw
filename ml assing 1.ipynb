    "Q3: Explain underfitting. List scenarios where underfitting can occur in ML.\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It results in high training and test errors, indicating that the model fails to learn effectively.\n",
    "Scenarios of Underfitting\n",
    "Using Too Simple Models: Applying linear regression to a non-linear dataset.\n",
    "Inadequate Feature Representation: Features do not capture the complexity of the data.          \n",
    "Insufficient Training Time: Training the model for too few epochs.\n",
    "Excessive Regularization: Over-regularizing can prevent the model from learning necessary patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and how do they affect model performance?\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept that describes the balance between two types of errors in machine learning models:\n",
    "Bias: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm, leading to underfitting. High bias results in models that cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "Variance: Error due to excessive sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting. High variance results in models that capture noise rather than the signal.\n",
    "Relationship\n",
    "The relationship between bias and variance is inversely proportional: as one decreases, the other tends to increase. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes total error, leading to optimal model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Discuss some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models. How can you determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting?\n",
    "Common Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Curves: Plotting training and validation error against the number of training instances. A large gap indicates overfitting, while high error for both suggests underfitting.\n",
    "Cross-Validation Scores: Evaluating model performance using k-fold cross-validation can help identify generalization performance.\n",
    "Performance Metrics: Monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall on both training and validation datasets can reveal discrepancies indicative of overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "Determination\n",
    "Overfitting: High training accuracy but low validation accuracy.\n",
    "Underfitting: High error rates on both training and validation datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Compare and contrast bias and variance in machine learning. What are some examples of high bias and high variance models, and how do they differ in terms of their performance?\n",
    "Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "High Bias:\n",
    "Models that are too simple (e.g., linear regression for complex data).\n",
    "Result in underfitting, performing poorly on both training and test data.\n",
    "High Variance:\n",
    "Models that are overly complex (e.g., deep decision trees).\n",
    "Result in overfitting, performing well on training data but poorly on test data.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "High Bias Model: A linear regression model applied to a non-linear dataset will likely underfit, showing high error on both training and test sets.\n",
    "High Variance Model: A complex decision tree that perfectly fits the training data will likely overfit, showing low training error but high test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? Describe some common regularization techniques and how they work.\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for complexity to the loss function during model training. This encourages the model to find a balance between fitting the training data and maintaining simplicity.\n",
    "Common Regularization Techniques\n",
    "Lasso Regularization (L1):\n",
    "Adds an L1 penalty to the loss function, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Ridge Regularization (L2):\n",
    "Adds an L2 penalty to the loss function, discouraging large coefficients but not setting them to zero.\n",
    "Elastic Net:\n",
    "Combines both L1 and L2 penalties, balancing between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "Dropout:\n",
    "In neural networks, randomly dropping units during training helps prevent co-adaptation of hidden units, reducing overfitting.\n",
    "These techniques help maintain a balance between fitting the training data well while ensuring good generalization to unseen data."
